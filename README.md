# Checkboxes

This was the 10th project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed. I made a checklist where you check the boxes individually OR you can check one box, hold down shift, and when you checked another box every item on the list between the first boxed you checked and the second box you checked would then be checked. 

Things I learned:

-how to make a checklist

Goals:

-Make mobile responsive
